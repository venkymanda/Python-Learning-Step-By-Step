    "First, you learned how to define your own custom functions. You saw\n",
    "that functions are made up of two parts:<br>\n",
    "1. The function signature, which starts with the def keyword and\n",
    "includes the name of the function and the function’s parameters\n",
    "2. The function body, which contains the code that runs whenever\n",
    "the function is called.<br>\n",
    "Functions help avoid repeating similar code throughout a program by\n",
    "creating re-usable components.<br> This helps make code easier to read\n",
    "and maintain.\n",
    "Then you learned about Python’s two kinds of loops:\n",
    "1. while loops repeat some code while some condition remains true\n",
    "2. for loops repeat some code for each element in a set of objects<br>\n",
