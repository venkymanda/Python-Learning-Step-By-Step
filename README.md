## Introduction
Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language used in various fields, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more. This guide aims to provide you with a structured learning path using Jupyter Notebooks within the VS Code environment, which offers a powerful and integrated experience for Python development.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- Visual Studio Code installed. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- The [Python extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) installed.
- Basic knowledge of using VS Code.
-Install [Jupyter notebooks extension in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)

## Getting Started with VS Code
To start your Python learning journey with VS Code and Jupyter Notebooks, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone <https://github.com/venkymanda/Python-Learning-Step-By-Step>
2. Open VS Code and navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Open the first Jupyter Notebook, "01-Introduction-to-Python.ipynb," by double-clicking on it.
4. You will be prompted to select a Python interpreter. Choose your preferred Python 3.x interpreter.
5. Start learning and coding in the Jupyter Notebook within VS Code!

## How to Use
Each notebook in this repository covers a specific topic or concept related to Python programming. Follow the notebooks in sequential order to build your Python skills progressively. You can run code cells directly within VS Code and see the results in the integrated Jupyter Notebook interface.
